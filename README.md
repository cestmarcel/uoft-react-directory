## Usage

You can use this application to keep track of your employees and their personal details. You can use it to look up a specific employee by entering some of their personal details into the search field.

There is a search field that filters the results based on the input (name, phone number, email, date of birth). Each column can also be sorted by clicking on the column title. It switches between ascending and descending sorting.
